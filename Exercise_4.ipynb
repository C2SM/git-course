    "## Goals\n",
    "   * Exercise the typical Git-workflow\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "In this exercise we wont learn any new git-commands. We rather repeat all commands and workflows learned in the\n",
    "previous exercises. To do so we work on the *partyplan.txt* document, and simulate a possible workflow. \n",
    "Because it is all repetition, there is less explanation provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw outline of this workflow:\n",
    "   * Add food and people\n",
    "   * Ben does not bring juice\n",
    "   * Add schedule to document\n",
    "   * \"Accidentially\" delete all files, recover it\n",
    "   * Change schedule in another branch\n",
    "   * Create two additional branches for different music options\n",
    "   * Merge new schedule into master\n",
    "   * Delete merged branch\n",
    "   * Merge your preferred music branch into master and delete merged branch\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow a smooth exercise, there are some functions written by C2SM in the file *helpers.sh* that are **NOT** part of Git. For this exercise we us the following functions from that file:\n",
    "   * **reset:** It will delete the *work* folder and enable you a clean restart of the exercise in case you completely mess it up\n",
    "   * **init_empty_folder:** create and empty folder and enter it."
