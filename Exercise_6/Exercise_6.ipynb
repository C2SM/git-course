    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will change the same file on different branches in a way that we create a merge conflict. There will be also a change in the remote repository, which will equally lead into a merge conflict when trying to pull from that branch.\n",
    "Again, the exercise consists of short descriptions about a specific Git command, followed by a practical part where you can execute appropriate Git commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow a smooth exercise, there are some functions written by C2SM in the file *helpers.sh* that are **NOT** part of Git. For this exercise we use the following functions from that file:\n",
    "   * **init_exercise:** It will create the *work* directory and navigate into it \n",
    "   * **reset:** It will delete the *work* folder and enable you a clean restart of the exercise in case you completely mess it up\n",
    "   * **init_repo_remote:** setup a Git repository containing a first version of schedule_day1 and a remote repo containing the same version of schedule_day1 on a different branch called \"updated_schedules\".\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Reminder:** all text enclosed with `<>` denotes a placeholder to be replaced by a specific string appropriate in your context._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Reminder:** What we refer to as the **main** branch may be called **master** branch depending on your version of Git._\n",
