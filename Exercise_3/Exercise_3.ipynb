    "## Goals\n",
    "   * Restore version of files at some point in the Git history\n",
    "   * Merge two branches (without merge conflicts)\n",
    "   * Delete unused branches\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "In this exercise we will continue working on planning the two-day conference using schedule_day1 and schedule_day2 for planning each day. First we need to revert the schedules to a specific commit. Then we modify the same file, but in different branches. Finally, we merge all our changes into branch main.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again the exercise consists of short descriptions about a specific git command (less detailed than in previous exercises), followed by a hands-on part for you to execute appropiate git commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow a smooth exercise, there are some functions written by C2SM in the file *helpers.sh* that are **NOT** part of Git. For this exercise we us the following functions from that file:\n",
    "   * **init_exercise:** It will create the *work* directory and navigate into it \n",
    "   * **reset:** It will delete the *work* folder and enable you a clean restart of the exercise in case you completely mess it up\n",
    "   * **init_broken_repo:** setup a Git repository as in exercise 2, but with commits, that we need to revert first.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Reminder:** all text enclosed with `<>` denotes a placeholder to be replaced by a specific string appropriate in your context._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Reminder:** Always run `git commit` and `git merge` with a git message `-m <meaningful_message>`. Otherwise git may try to open the git editor, which does not work on jupyter notebook and will break your current session._\n",
