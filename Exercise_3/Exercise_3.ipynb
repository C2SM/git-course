    "   * Checkout files at some point in the Git history\n",
    "   * Merge two branches (without merge conflicts)\n",
    "   * Delete unused branches\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "In this exercise we will continue working on flyers (flyer_A and flyer_B) for two parties (Party A and Party B). First we need to revert the flyers to a specific commit. Then we modify the same file, but in different branches. Finally we merge all our changes into branch master.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Again the exercise consists of short descriptions about a specific git command (less detailed than in previous exercises), followed by a hands-on part for you to execute appropiate git commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow a smooth exercise, there are some functions written by C2SM in the file *helpers.sh* that are **NOT** part of Git. For this exercise we us the following functions from that file:\n",
    "   * **init_exercise:** It will create the *work* directory and navigate into it \n",
    "   * **reset:** It will delete the *work* folder and enable you a clean restart of the exercise in case you completely mess it up\n",
    "   * **init_broken_repo:** setup a Git repository as in exercise 2, but with commits, that we need to revert first."
