    "In this exercise we will work on flyers (flyer_A and flyer_B) for two parties (Party A and Party B). The flyers should contain information about the location, music, door opening and so on. For adding the information to the flyers we work in separate branches to not mix things up.  \n",
    "Again, the exercise consists of short descriptions about a specific Git command, followed by a practical part where you can execute appropriate Git commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow a smooth exercise, there are some functions written by C2SM in the file *helpers.sh* that are **NOT** part of Git. For this exercise we use the following functions from that file:\n",
    "   * **init_exercise:** It will create the *work* directory and navigate into it \n",
    "   * **reset:** It will delete the *work* folder and enable you a clean restart of the exercise in case you completely mess it up\n",
    "   * **init_simple_repo:** setup a Git repository containing a first version of the flyer_A and flyer_B in branch *master*.\n",
