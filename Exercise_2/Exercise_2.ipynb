    "In this exercise we will work on flyers (flyer_A and flyer_B) for two parties (Party A and Party B). The flyers should contain information about the location, music, door opening and so on. For adding the information to the flyers we work in separate branches to not mix things up.  \n",

    "In order to allow a smooth exercise, there are some functions written by C2SM in the file *helpers.sh* that are **NOT** part of Git. For this exercise we us the following functions from that file:\n",
    "   * **reset:** It will delete the *work* folder and enable you a clean restart of the exercise in case you completely mess it up\n",
    "   * **init_simple_repo:** setup a Git repository containing a first version of the flyer_A and flyer_B in branch *master* "
