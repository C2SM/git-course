    "## Goals\n",
    "   * Practice the typical Git workflow\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "In this exercise we won't learn any new Git commands. We rather repeat all commands and workflows learned in the\n",
    "previous exercises. To do so we work on the *conference_schedule.txt* document and simulate a possible workflow.\n",
    "Because it is all repetition, there is less explanation provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw outline of this workflow:\n",
    "   * Add events\n",
    "   * Change events\n",
    "   * Add more events\n",
    "   * \"Accidentially\" delete all files, recover it\n",
    "   * Change one event in another branch (alternative schedule)\n",
    "   * Create two additional branches for different evening activity options\n",
    "   * Merge the alternative schedule into main\n",
    "   * Delete merged branch\n",
    "   * Merge your preferred evening activity into main\n",
    "   * Delete merged branch and unused branch\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow a smooth exercise, there are some functions written by C2SM in the file *helpers.sh* that are **NOT** part of Git. For this exercise we us the following functions from that file:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **init_exercise:** It will create the *work* directory and navigate into it \n",
    "   * **reset:** It will delete the *work* folder and enable you a clean restart of the exercise in case you completely mess it up\n",
    "   * **init_empty_folder:** create the directory `conference_planning` and the empty file `conference_schedule.txt` in it.\n",
    "   \n",
    "_**Reminder:** all text enclosed with `<>` denotes a placeholder to be replaced by a specific string appropriate in your context._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Reminder:** Always run `git commit` and `git merge` with a git message `-m <meaningful_message>`. Otherwise Git may try to open the Git editor, which does not work on jupyter notebook and will break your current session._\n",
