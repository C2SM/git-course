    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "* Create Git repository from scratch\n",
    "* Track changes in files using `git add`, `git status` and `git commit`\n",
    "* Know state of Git repo using `git diff` and `git log`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "This exercise consists of short descriptions about a specific git command, followed by a practical part where you can execute appropriate Git commands. \n",
    "In order to allow a smooth exercise, there are some functions written by C2SM in the file *helpers.sh* that are **NOT** part of Git. For this exercise we use the following functions from that file:\n",
    "   * **init_exercise:** It will create the *work* directory and navigate into it \n",
    "   * **reset:** It will delete the *work* folder and enable you a clean restart of the exercise in case you completely mess it up.\n",
    "   \n",
    "In the following (and all further exercises), all text enclosed with `<>` denotes a placeholder to be replaced by a specific string appropriate in **your** context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start exercises in correct folder\n",
    "This exercise (and all further exercises) assume that the shell is already located in the folder of the exercise notebooks. It could happen, for some reason, that the notebook does not by default switch to the folder of the notebook. In that case you need to manually change the directory first in order to do the exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the command  \n",
    "\n",
    "`pwd`  \n",
    "returns something similar to    \n",
    "`/home/juckerj/git-course/Exercise_1`    \n",
    "everything is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case it returns only    \n",
    "`/home/juckerj`  \n",
    "please go the right directory.\n",
