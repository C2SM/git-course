## How to run the exercises
First of all, you need a Git installation on your computer.
To do so, please follow the [instructions from GitHub](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

> **_Important note:_**  You must have at least Git 2.28 (released 27 July 2020) installed. 
> You can check your Git version by typing `git --version` in your terminal.

Second, you need a Python installation as well.
We provide you here with [instructions from realpython](https://realpython.com/installing-python/),
but of course many other instruction will do it as well.

Now, use your own terminal to go through the exercises, which are all desecribed in the Markdown files.

**Have fun!**
