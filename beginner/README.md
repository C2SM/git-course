# Git Course for Beginners
This folder contains the exercises for the C2SM Git Workshop "Git for Beginners".
Feel free to download the material to practice and enhance your Git skills.

A Markdown version of the .ipynb files for each exercise is located in the [Markdowns folder](Markdowns).

We recommend that you use the convenient way of doing the exercises with Jupyter Notebook itself.
