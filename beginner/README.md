# Git Course for Beginners
This folder contains the exercises for the C2SM Git Workshop "Git for Beginners".
Feel free to download the material to practice and enhance your Git skills.

The corresponding [slides of this course](https://wiki.c2sm.ethz.ch/CM/PastTrainings) can be found on the C2SM wiki.

A Markdown version of the .ipynb files for each exercise is located in the [Markdowns folder](Markdowns).

We recommend that you use the convenient way of doing the exercises with Jupyter Notebook itself.

See the [Getting Started section](https://github.com/C2SM/git-course/#getting-started) for installation instructions of Git and Python.
