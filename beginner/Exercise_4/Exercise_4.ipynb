    "## Exercise 4\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "   * Practice the typical Git workflow\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "In this exercise, we won't be learning any new Git commands. Rather, we will review all the commands and workflows we learned in the previous exercises. We will do this by working on the *conference_schedule.txt* document and simulating a possible workflow.\n",
    "Since this is a review, there will be less explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Helper Functions\n",
    "The following helper functions in the file *helpers.sh* are written by C2SM and are **NOT** **part of Git**. They will set up simple repositories for you that have a short Git history, so that you have something to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will use the following functions from this file:\n",
    "   * **init_exercise:** This will create the *beginners_git* directory in the parent directory of the *git-course* directory. It will also delete any old version of the *beginners_git* directory, so don't use the *beginners_git* directory to save any work.\n",
    "   * **reset:** This will delete the *beginners_git* directory and allows you a clean restart of the exercise in case you messed it up completely.\n",
    "   * **init_repo_empty_schedule:** This will create the directory `conference_planning` and a file `conference_schedule.txt` with an empty schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remarks\n",
    "_**Reminder:** Any text enclosed in `<>` denotes a placeholder to be replaced with a specific string appropriate to your context, i.e. delete `<>` and replace it with the appropriate word._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Reminder:** Always run `git commit` and `git merge` with a git message `-m <meaningful_message>`. Otherwise Git may try to open the Git editor, which does not work on jupyter notebook and will break your current session._\n",
