    "## Helper Functions\n",
    "The following helper functions in the file *helpers.sh* are written by C2SM and are **NOT** **part of Git**. They will set up simple repositories for you that have a short Git history, so that you have something to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will use the following functions from this file:\n",
    "   * **init_exercise:** This will create the *beginners_git* directory in the parent directory of the *git-course* directory. It will also delete any old version of the *beginners_git* directory, so don't use the *beginners_git* directory to save any work.\n",
    "   * **reset:** This will delete the *beginners_git* directory and allows you a clean restart of the exercise in case you messed it up completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remarks\n",
    "_**Reminder:** Any text enclosed in `<>` denotes a placeholder to be replaced with a specific string appropriate to your context, i.e. delete `<>` and replace it with the appropriate word._\n",
