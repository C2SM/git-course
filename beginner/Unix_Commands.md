# Basic Unix Commands

In this Git course some very basic Unix commands will be used.
This document describes **ALL** commands needed below:

   * `ls`: list all files/folders in current directory
   
   * `cd`: change directory, e.g. `cd test` will go to folder 'test'. To go one directory up, type `cd ..` 
   
   * `cat`: concatenate files, in our case we only use it to display the content of text file, e.g. `cat my_file.txt` prints the content of *my_file.txt* to the terminal.
   
   * `source`: run script in the current shell, this means that all variables and functions defined in that file will be available in the current shell
   
   * `echo`: display a line of text
   
   * `>`: redirect ouput to file/device after `>`, overwrites already existing file
   * `>>`: redirect output to file/device after `>>`, appends and does not delete already existing file.    
   * `mkdir`: create directory/folder, e.g. `mkdir test` will create directory 'test'
