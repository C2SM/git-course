    "## Exercise 3\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "   * Restore the version of files at some point in the Git history\n",
    "   * Merge two branches (without merge conflicts)\n",
    "   * Delete unused branches\n",
    "   \n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "In this exercise we will continue working on the schedule for the two-day conference using *schedule_day1.txt* and *schedule_day2.txt* for each day's schedule. First, we need to revert the schedules back to a specific commit. Then we modify the same file, but on different branches. Finally, we merge all our changes back to the *main* branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this exercise will consist of short descriptions of specific Git commands, followed by a hands-on part where you will be able to execute the corresponding Git commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Helper Functions\n",
    "The following helper functions in the file *helpers.sh* are written by C2SM and are **NOT** **part of Git**. They will set up simple repositories for you that have a short Git history, so that you have something to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will use the following functions from this file:\n",
    "   * **init_exercise:** This will create the *beginners_git* directory in the parent directory of the *git-course* directory. It will also delete any old version of the *beginners_git* directory, so don't use the *beginners_git* directory to save any work.\n",
    "   * **reset:** This will delete the *beginners_git* directory and allows you a clean restart of the exercise in case you messed it up completely.\n",
    "   * **init_repo:** This sets up a Git repository as in Exercise 2, but with more commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remarks\n",
    "_**Reminder:** Any text enclosed in `<>` denotes a placeholder to be replaced with a specific string appropriate to your context, i.e. delete `<>` and replace it with the appropriate word._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Reminder:** Always run `git commit` and `git merge` with a git message `-m <meaningful_message>`. Otherwise Git may try to open the Git editor, which does not work on jupyter notebook and will break your current session._\n",
