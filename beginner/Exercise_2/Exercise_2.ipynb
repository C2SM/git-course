    "## Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "   * Learn how to work with branches and switch between them using `git switch`.\n",
    "   * Note: `git checkout` can be used as an alternative to `git switch`. However, it has different features that have caused confusion among users in the past. So we won't use it here, but show the alternative commands in brackets, as some older Git versions don't have this option yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "In this exercise, we will work on scheduling a two-day conference using two files that contain the schedules for day 1 and day 2 (*schedule_day1.txt* and *schedule_day2.txt*). To add events to the schedules (e.g., talks, poster sessions, etc.), we will work on separate branches so as not to mix things up.\n",
    "Again, this exercise will consist of short descriptions of specific Git commands, followed by a hands-on part where you will be able to execute the corresponding Git commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Helper Functions\n",
    "The following helper functions in the file *helpers.sh* are written by C2SM and are **NOT** **part of Git**. They will set up simple repositories for you that have a short Git history, so that you have something to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will use the following functions from this file:\n",
    "   * **init_exercise:** This will create the *beginners_git* directory in the parent directory of the *git-course* directory. It will also delete any old version of the *beginners_git* directory, so don't use the *beginners_git* directory to save any work.\n",
    "   * **reset:** This will delete the *beginners_git* directory and allows you a clean restart of the exercise in case you messed it up completely.\n",
    "   * **init_simple_repo:** This will set up a Git repository containing a first version of *schedule_day1.txt* and *schedule_day2.txt* on the *main* branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remarks\n",
    "_**Reminder:** Any text enclosed in `<>` denotes a placeholder to be replaced with a specific string appropriate to your context, i.e. delete `<>` and replace it with the appropriate word._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note:** Always run `git commit` and `git merge` with a Git message `-m <meaningful_message>`. Otherwise Git may try to open the Git editor, which does not work on jupyter notebook and will break your current session._\n",
