    "For the Git course, we will be using a special notebook that allows us to write and run commands just like we would in the computer's terminal. To make this possible, we use a special Juypter kernel (bash-kernel) in our Jupyter notebook. Think of it as a plugin that helps your notebook understand and execute terminal commands. We need to make sure that this bash kernel is set up before we start the course. To do this, first run the cell below and follow the steps based on the output of the cell below:"
