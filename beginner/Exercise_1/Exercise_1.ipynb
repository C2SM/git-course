    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "* Create a Git repository from scratch\n",
    "* Track changes to files using `git add`, `git status`, and `git commit`\n",
    "* Know the state of the Git repository using `git diff` and `git log`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "This exercise consists of short descriptions of specific Git commands, followed by a hands-on part where you will be able to execute the corresponding Git commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Helper Functions\n",
    "The following helper functions in the file *helpers.sh* are written by C2SM and are **NOT** **part of Git**. They will set up simple repositories for you that have a short Git history, so that you have something to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will use the following functions from this file:\n",
    "   * **init_exercise:** This will create the *beginners_git* directory in the parent directory of the *git-course* directory. It will also delete any old version of the *beginners_git* directory, so don't use the *beginners_git* directory to save any work.\n",
    "   * **reset:** This will delete the *beginners_git* directory and allows you a clean restart of the exercise in case you messed it up completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remarks   \n",
    "_**Note:** Any text enclosed in `<>` denotes a placeholder to be replaced with a specific string appropriate to your context, i.e. delete `<>` and replace it with the appropriate word._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note:** The exercises require you to use basic Unix commands. If you are not familiar with Unix systems, we have listed all the necessary commands in the file [Basic Unix Commands](../Unix_Commands.ipynb)._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Start exercises in correct folder:**\n",
    "This exercise (and all the exercises that follow) assume that the shell is already in the folder where the exercise notebooks are located. For some reason, the notebook may not switch to the notebook folder by default. In this case, you will need to manually change the directory in order to complete the exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `pwd` command returns something like `/home/juckerj/git-course/beginner/Exercise_1`, everything is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it returns something like `/home/juckerj`, change to the correct directory.\n"
