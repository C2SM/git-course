    "## Exercise 6\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "   * Learn how to deal with merge conflicts:\n",
    "       * Undo merge\n",
    "       * Choose preferred version\n",
    "       * Adapt file directly\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will change the same file on different branches in a way that we create a merge conflict. There will also be a change in the remote repository, which will equally lead into a merge conflict when trying to pull from that branch.\n",
    "Again, the exercise consists of short descriptions about a specific Git command, followed by a practical part where you can execute appropriate Git commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow a smooth exercise, there are some functions written by C2SM in the file *helpers.sh* that are **NOT** part of Git. For this exercise we use the following functions from that file:\n",
    "   * **init_exercise:** It will create the *work* directory and navigate into it \n",
    "   * **reset:** It will delete the *work* folder and enable you a clean restart of the exercise in case you completely mess it up\n",
    "   * **init_repo_remote:** setup a Git repository containing a first version of _schedule_day1.txt_ and a remote repo containing the same version of _schedule_day1.txt_ on a different branch called \"updated_schedules\".\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Reminder:** Any text enclosed in `<>` denotes a placeholder to be replaced with a specific string appropriate to your context, i.e. delete `<>` and replace it with the appropriate word._\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Reminder:** Always run `git commit` and `git merge` with a git message `-m <meaningful_message>`. Otherwise Git may try to open the Git editor, which does not work on jupyter notebook and will break your current session._\n",
